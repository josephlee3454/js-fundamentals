                    JavaScript Basics
                    JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. 
                    JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small<br>
                     and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a
                    bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host<br> environment 
                    (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over <br>
                    them.

                    <ul class="lister">
                        <li>
                            <div class="under-blue">Variable Declaration</div> JavaScript variables are containers for 
                            storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, 
                            the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. 
                            All JavaScript variables must be identified with 
                            unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. var x=10;
                        </li>
                        <li><div class="under-blue">Variable Assignment</div> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript 
                            variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our 
                            variable a value to hold. 
                            The = assignment operator assigns a value to adiv class="under-blue"> variable. var x= 10;</li>
                        <li><div class="under-blue">Data Types</div>div Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate 
                            on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are 
                            JavaScript primitives: Boolean, - true or false; null - null aka nothing; Number 
                            - 42 or 3.14159; String - "Coding Dojo Rocks!;" Array 
                            - [1,'Coding',2,'Dojo']; and Object - {first_name:'Jane',last_name:'Doe'}</li>
                        <li><div class="under-blue">Conditionals</div>div> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditionals that have been met. 
                            You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. 
                            There are the following conditional statements: if a specified condition is 
                            true, do this code in our code block; else if to specify a new condition 
                            to test, if the first condition is false; else we execute this block of code;</li>
                        <li><div class="under-blue">Loops</div>There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language,
                             but essentially do the same thing: they
                             will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, 
                            well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop!</li>
                        <li><div class="under-blue">Functions </div>Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are
                             putting together a desk from Ikea, we open the instruction manual 
                            and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we 
                            place the table rig>ht way up. Done! We finished out instructions. Sadly there
                             a a ton more table to do so lets call our function over and over again.</li>
